About
#####

This project is like the J.A.R.V.I.S IA built by Tony Stark in the Iron Man films.

I decided to create my own Digital Life Assistant because I didn't found any good project to contribute, or the concept wasn't good enough to fit my needs. I want something fast, easy to understand, easy to edit, easy to add features. Something small enough to run on a cheap computer like Raspberry Pi.

L.I.S.A will assist me as a Digital Life Assistant.

It will give me usefull informations even if I didn't ask these, and answer me when I will ask something I want to know or to do.
I actually have my house managed by a Vera-Lite controller (Zwave).
L.I.S.A will be able to manage it (and other box with a simple module) and allow me to control with my house by voice.
